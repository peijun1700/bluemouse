# 🐭 BlueMouse v7.0 Roadmap (Future Vision)

**Current Status:** v6.1 (Core Logic Engine & SaaS UI Completed)
**Next Phase:** Commercialization & Frontend Expansion

---

## 1. 💰 Payment & SaaS Integration (商業化接入)
*   **Goal:** Allow users to upgrade/pay for advanced features.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   Add a **"Upgrade Plan" (升級方案)** button in the current `bluemouse_saas.html` dashboard.
    *   Link this button to the **Company Website** (External URL) where pricing tables and Stripe checkout will live.
    *   Upon successful payment, the user receives a License Key to unlock "Enterprise Mode" features in the Python backend.

## 2. 🎨 UI Template System (前端模板引擎)
*   **Goal:** After BlueMouse generates the backend logic (Architecture + Python Code), allow users to "skin" it instantly.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   **Post-Generation Step**: Add a new "Choose UI" step after the `mmla_validate_code` phase.
    *   **Template Gallery**:
        *   Template A: Dashboard Admin (React/Tailwind)
        *   Template B: Landing Page (HTML5/CSS)
        *   Template C: Mobile App (React Native)
    *   **Integration**: Automatically inject the generated Backend API endpoints into the selected Frontend Template.
