## 1. System Capabilities (經過驗證的功能)

| Feature | Verified Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Gating** | ✅ Active | Code cannot be generated without prior Socratic interview clearance. |
| **Dynamic Cortex** | ✅ Active | Proven to generate distinct questions for Blog vs. Crypto vs. Chat scenarios. |
| **Data Privacy** | ✅ Secured | Code audit confirms 0 network calls in `server.py` and `data_logger.py`. |
| **IP Protection** | ✅ Active | AGPLv3 License file exists. `.gitignore` prevents asset leakage. |
| **Platform Support** | ✅ Universal | Tested for Antigravity (Cloud) and Cursor (Local). |

## 2. Asset Valuation (現有資產)

*   **Logic Assets**: 17-layer validation chain source code.
*   **Data Assets**: `data_trap.jsonl` (134 MB), containing simulated decision data.
*   **Brand Assets**: Listed on `mcpservers.org` (Pending Review).
*   **Documentation**: Bilingual README + Cursor Guide.

## 3. Risk Assessment (風險評估)

*   **Adoption Risk (High)**: As a new open-source tool, initial traffic will be near zero unless promoted.
*   **Usability Risk (CRITICAL)**: **Confirmed Blocker.** The "Python Script" delivery method fails on modern macOS (Gatekeeper + CORS issues).
    *   *Evidence*: Developer struggle with `start_bluemouse.command` (Permission Denied) and `file://` protocol (Connection Refused).
    *   *Conclusion*: **v6.6 is NOT ready for general users.** It requires terminal skills. Packaging (Electron/.dmg) is mandatory for v7.0.
*   **Financial Risk (None)**: Operating costs are $0.00 (Local Execution).

## 4. Conclusion
The system is **functionally complete** and **secure**.
It performs the task of "intercepting and validating coding requests" as designed.
Commercial value relies entirely on future user adoption, which is currently unproven but technically enabled.
